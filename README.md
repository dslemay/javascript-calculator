The specific project assignment can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator). Objectives and user stories for this assignment have been copied below.

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/rLJZrA/.

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

1. User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
